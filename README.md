[Metric-centered and technology-independent architectural views for software comprehension](https://jserd.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40411-018-0060-6) introduces that maintaining software applications is a critical, yet costly task within the software industry, primarily due to the substantial effort required for software comprehension. This difficulty often comes from the lack of updated documentations, and leaving developers to rely solely on the source code. Various commercial and academic tools aim to generate software architectural views from code, but they face significant limitations, such as (i)they are dependent on specific programming languages or technologies, and (ii)they offer predefined views that are challenging to customize for specific comprehension needs.

This article shows a technology-independent method that provides flexibility for developers to create metric-centered architectural views using annotations. These views integrate architectural elements within a single canvas, where their appearance reflects different software metrics. This approach has been validated through collaborations with software modernization across various technologies, including Oracle Forms, Java EE, and Ruby on Rails. And this article discusses the application of this method in multiple contexts and compare its effectiveness with traditional procedures.

# Personal Comment

This article is interesting as it talks about the flexible approach that lets developers create visual representations of software architecture using annotations, regardless of the technology they're working with. In these visualizations, different parts of the architecture are displayed on a single canvas, with their appearance changing based on specific software metrics. The method has been tested in real-world software modernization projects, including work with Oracle Forms, Java EE, and Ruby on Rails. The article also looks at how this approach works in different situations and compares it to more traditional methods. Wilson Xu
